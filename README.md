This mod lets the roboport send to the network all ghosts in its construction area
_Nota: It is the successor of the mod Roboport Converter, but with a better name!_

# How does it work:
Nothing special to do. No technology to research or specific item to create.
When a ghost is in the range of a roboport construction radius, this one will add a signal for this ghost on its logistic networks.
To prevent performances issues, the system reacts only on creation/destruction of ghosts, rather than ticks.
